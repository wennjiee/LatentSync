## 📖 Abstract

We present *LatentSync*, an end-to-end lip sync framework based on audio conditioned latent diffusion models without any intermediate motion representation, diverging from previous diffusion-based lip sync methods based on pixel space diffusion or two-stage generation. Our framework can leverage the powerful capabilities of Stable Diffusion to directly model complex audio-visual correlations. Additionally, we found that the diffusion-based lip sync methods exhibit inferior temporal consistency due to the inconsistency in the diffusion process across different frames. We propose *Temporal REPresentation Alignment (TREPA)* to enhance temporal consistency while preserving lip-sync accuracy. TREPA uses temporal representations extracted by large-scale self-supervised video models to align the generated frames with the ground truth frames.

## 🏗️ Framework

<p>

LatentSync uses the [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to convert melspectrogram into audio embeddings, which are then integrated into the U-Net via cross-attention layers. The reference and masked frames are channel-wise concatenated with noised latents as the input of U-Net. In the training process, we use a one-step method to get estimated clean latents from predicted noises, which are then decoded to obtain the estimated clean frames. The TREPA, [LPIPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03924) and [SyncNet](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2016/Chung16a/chung16a.pdf) losses are added in the pixel space.

## 📑 Open-source Plan

- [x] Inference code and checkpoints
- [x] Data processing pipeline
- [x] Training code

## 🔧 Setting up the Environment

Install the required packages and download the checkpoints via:

```bash
source setup_env.sh
```

If the download is successful, the checkpoints should appear as follows:

```
./checkpoints/
|-- latentsync_unet.pt
|-- latentsync_syncnet.pt
|-- whisper
|   `-- tiny.pt
|-- auxiliary
|   |-- 2DFAN4-cd938726ad.zip
|   |-- i3d_torchscript.pt
|   |-- koniq_pretrained.pkl
|   |-- s3fd-619a316812.pth
|   |-- sfd_face.pth
|   |-- syncnet_v2.model
|   |-- vgg16-397923af.pth
|   `-- vit_g_hybrid_pt_1200e_ssv2_ft.pth
```

These already include all the checkpoints required for latentsync training and inference. If you just want to try inference, you only need to download `latentsync_unet.pt` and `tiny.pt` from our [HuggingFace repo](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/LatentSync)

## 🚀 Inference

There are two ways to perform inference, and both require 6.5 GB of VRAM.

### 1. Gradio App

Run the Gradio app for inference:

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

### 2. Command Line Interface

Run the script for inference:

```bash
./inference.sh
```

You can change the parameters `inference_steps` and `guidance_scale` to see more results.

## 🔄 Data Processing Pipeline

The complete data processing pipeline includes the following steps:

1. Remove the broken video files.
2. Resample the video FPS to 25, and resample the audio to 16000 Hz.
3. Scene detect via [PySceneDetect](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect).
4. Split each video into 5-10 second segments.
5. Remove videos where the face is smaller than 256 $\times$ 256, as well as videos with more than one face.
6. Affine transform the faces according to the landmarks detected by [face-alignment](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment), then resize to 256 $\times$ 256.
7. Remove videos with [sync confidence score](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2016/Chung16a/chung16a.pdf) lower than 3, and adjust the audio-visual offset to 0.
8. Calculate [hyperIQA](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Su_Blindly_Assess_Image_Quality_in_the_Wild_Guided_by_a_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) score, and remove videos with scores lower than 40.

Run the script to execute the data processing pipeline:

```bash
./data_processing_pipeline.sh
```

You can change the parameter `input_dir` in the script to specify the data directory to be processed. The processed data will be saved in the `high_visual_quality` directory. Each step will generate a new directory to prevent the need to redo the entire pipeline in case the process is interrupted by an unexpected error.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training U-Net

Before training, you must process the data as described above and download all the checkpoints. We released a pretrained SyncNet with 94% accuracy on the VoxCeleb2 dataset for the supervision of U-Net training. Note that this SyncNet is trained on affine transformed videos, so when using or evaluating this SyncNet, you need to perform affine transformation on the video first (the code of affine transformation is included in the data processing pipeline).

If all the preparations are complete, you can train the U-Net with the following script:

```bash
./train_unet.sh
```

You should change the parameters in U-Net config file to specify the data directory, checkpoint save path, and other training hyperparameters.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training SyncNet

In case you want to train SyncNet on your own datasets, you can run the following script. The data processing pipeline for SyncNet is the same as U-Net. 

```bash
./train_syncnet.sh
```

After `validations_steps` training, the loss charts will be saved in `train_output_dir`. They contain both the training and validation loss.

## 📊 Evaluation

You can evaluate the [sync confidence score](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2016/Chung16a/chung16a.pdf) of a generated video by running the following script:

```bash
./eval/eval_sync_conf.sh
```

You can evaluate the accuracy of SyncNet on a dataset by running the following script:

```bash
./eval/eval_syncnet_acc.sh
```
